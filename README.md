# Portfolio Frontend (React)

This is the frontend of my personal portfolio website, built with **React** and connected to a **Strapi headless backend**.  
It is a fully dynamic and responsive portfolio website designed to display my work and background.

## Overview

The website includes five main pages:

1. **Home:**  
   Contains sections such as banner, work technologies, work experience, services, projects, and testimonials.

2. **About:**  
   Includes information and an image about myself.

3. **Projects:**  
   Displays a collection of all projects with details fetched from Strapi.

4. **Blog:**  
   Shows all blog posts dynamically loaded from the backend.

5. **Contact:**  
   Allows visitors to fill out a form to contact me. Also includes my contact details.

The **header** and **footer** are common for all pages.
